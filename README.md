ISSUES I ENCOUNTERED

- I had issues with the data provided in the airport.json. Due to the inconsistency of the data from the airport.json and the flight-listing.json file, I was unable to select information (Departure airport and Arrival Airport) from the popup modal, then search/find the airports and show results in the FlightListing page.
